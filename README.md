# Cyclistics Bike Share CaseStudy 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

# Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

# Data Analysis 
I have used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company.
I was using Data of one year from April 2020 to April 2021 .

ROCCC approach is used to determine the credibility of the data

Reliable – It is complete and accurate and it represents all bike rides taken in the city of Chicago for the selected duration of our analysis.
Original - The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. which operates the city of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service which is powered by Lyft.

### You can check my powerBI Report .

# Here are my  recommendations based on above key findings:
* Design riding packages by keeping recreational activities, weekend contests, and summer events in mind and offer special discounts and
  coupons on such events to encourage casual riders get annual membership.
* Design seasonal packages, It allows flexibility and encourages casual riders to get membership for specific periods if they are not willing to pay for annual subscription.
